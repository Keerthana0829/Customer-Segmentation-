# Customer Segmentation: Elevating Restaurants  with K-Means Clustering and Personalized SMS Marketing System
This project uses K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral data, enabling businesses to tailor strategies for different customer groups.
A key highlight of the project is the integration of Twilio, which allows sending personalized messages to customers in each cluster, enhancing customer communication and engagement.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
To get started with the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
  -Python 3.7 or higher
  -Required Python libraries
  -Twilio account and API credentials for messaging integration

# Introduction
This repository contains an ML-based project that utilizes K-Means clustering to segment customers for elevating restaurants. The goal of this project is to provide insights into customer behavior, preferences, and demographics, enabling restaurants to tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive business growth.

# Project Overview
- This project uses K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their demographics, behavior, and preferences.
- The project is built using Python and utilizes popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is can be downloaded from Kaggle either use synthetic dataset by using dataset code.
- The dataset contains [1000] rows and [14] columns, including features such as customer demographics, behavior, and preferences.

 # libraries Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- twilio.rest

# Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- Feature Engineering: New features are engineered to improve the clustering results.
- K-Means Clustering: The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to segment customers into distinct clusters.

# Twilio Integration for Personalized Messaging
The project leverages Twilio's API to send targeted, personalized messages to customers based on their assigned cluster.

-Example Workflow:

Identify customer clusters (e.g., premium spenders, budget-conscious shoppers).
Craft tailored messages for each cluster.
Use Twilio to automate the delivery of messages via SMS.

# Usage
1. Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/keerthana0829/customer-segmentation.git 
2. Install the required libraries using pip install library name
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the project
